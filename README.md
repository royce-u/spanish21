# spanish21
Played with 6 decks and no 10's, Spanish 21 is a variation of Blackjack that reduces the house edge by 1% when basic strategy is applied.

Game: 
  The object of the game is to first beat the dealer without going over 21 and second, you must either beat the dealer or have the dealer bust.
  The hand consists of two cards. Its value is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. The highest hand, which consists of an ace and any card counted as 10 points, is called “blackjack”.
  Ace's are counted as 1 or 11.  Face cards count as 10.
  If the total value of your hand goes over 21, you go bust and lose. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than yours, you lose.
  
Betting:
  You have 3 bets that can be played: Main bet, Up-card, Down-card
  To win the Up card bet, player's first card must match the dealer's first card. 
  To win the Down card bet, player's second card must match the dealer's second card. 
  Any match pays 3-1, Suited match pays 13-1.
  To win the main bet, you must beat the dealer.  
  Blackjacks pay 3-2.
  
Rules: 
  Player's Blackjack always beats the Dealer's Blackjack.
